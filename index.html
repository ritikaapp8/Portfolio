    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I grew up in California and am 13. When I am not coding, I like spend time painting, reading, and gardening.</p>

    <p>I first started coding in 7th grade, and I have found interest to easily design your own creations and it is fun to play around with the designs you can make. I code in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>The completed projects I have made as of July 2021 with HTML, CSS< and JS: Painting wth Squares, Snake, PacMan, Delta Airlines, Hotel Reservation, Moving Art, and Minesweeper. The completed projects I have made as of July 2021 with Python: Trivia Quiz, My Quiz, TicTacToe, Division Calculator, Guess the Number, and Alphabet Number. </p>
